# IB-stock-indices-analysis

This project aims at analyzing stock indices of top Investment Banks namely:
1. Bank of America
2. CitiGroup
3. Goldman Sachs
4. JP Morgan
5. Morgan Stanley
6. Wells Fargo

We will consider the time period of Jan 1, 2006 to Jan 1, 2020 to see how each index fares in comparison to the other, analysing their volatility, moving averages, trends, correlation etc. We will also see how certain dates/events had an impact on the indices and their returns.

In the later phase of the project, we will work on time series forecasting and predicting the share price of the indices.
